# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
# Tuples are written with round brackets.

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

# Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
