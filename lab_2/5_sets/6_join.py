# There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.

# The union() and update() methods joins all items from both sets.

# The intersection() method keeps ONLY the duplicates.

# The difference() method keeps the items from the first set that are not in the other set(s).

# The symmetric_difference() method keeps all items EXCEPT the duplicates.




# The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets.
# Join set1 and set2 into a new set:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)

# You can use the | operator instead of the union() method, and you will get the same result.
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1 | set2
print(set3)



# Join multiple sets with the union() method:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = {"John", "Elena"}
set4 = {"apple", "bananas", "cherry"}
myset = set1.union(set2, set3, set4)   
# myset = set1 | set2 | set3 |set4
print(myset)


# The  | operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the  union() method.
# Join a set with a tuple:
x = {"a", "b", "c"}
y = (1, 2, 3)
z = x.union(y)
print(z)

print("-----------------")

# The update() method inserts all items from one set into another.
# The update() changes the original set, and does not return a new set.

# The update() method inserts the items in set2 into set1:
set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set1.update(set2)
print(set1)
# Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.




# The intersection() method will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.
# Join set1 and set2, but keep only the duplicates:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
print(set3)

# You can use the & operator instead of the intersection() method, and you will get the same result.
